# Black Canvas

Create art with code (a lisp like language called blisp). The language is interpreted by JavaScript and draws to a canvas context in the browser.

**CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT**

see `documentation/blisp, documentation/example_programs` for info regarding the language.

# Installation & Running

1. Node JS Version 16 should be installed
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`

Note if you want to use account functionality you must be on a unix system. Use `npm run db:init` to initalize the database. In another terminal `npm run dserver` to run the development server. The program can run without the development server.
